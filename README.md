# PhantomBatch

PhantomBatch has been written to take the hassle out of running many simulations simulatenously by doing all of the hard work for you!
The philosophy behind PhantomBatch is to think, set, and forget; Think about what set of parameters would be nice to explore, set a 
PhantomBatch config file, and forget since PhantomBatch will create, submit, check, and cancel your Phantom simulations for you!

Below is a list of features that have been added, or that I have already added, in no particular order of importance.

# Features to add:

- More setups
- Ability to pick up where it left off if accidentally aborted
