# PhantomBatch

PhantomBatch has been written to take the hassle out of running many simulations simulatenously by doing all of the hard work for you!
The philosophy behind PhantomBatch is to think, set, and forget; Think about what set of parameters would be nice to explore, set a 
PhantomBatch config file, and forget since PhantomBatch will create, submit, check, and cancel your Phantom simulations for you!
